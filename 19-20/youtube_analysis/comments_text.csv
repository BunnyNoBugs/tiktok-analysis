Long Time Past
"This Song really has a magic binding in it. Even if I don't hear it really much anymore, but everytime I hear it I get this feeling of nostalgia and even if things were dull at this time, through this track i got positive vibes and with it I can connect it with positive things which happened in my life though. Sometimes it gives you just the feeling again you had when you first heared it and that's why i'll always will listen to it.

I wish I could ever find such a good track again but it's impossible lol"

"Original Lyrics:
Hey commander, can you unplug me?
Just for a minute, I need some privacy
Headset off and stretch her neck out
Down the rocks to her head's safe house

Yeah, I remember if I'll bleed and shout out my calls
The air was so dusty
Her armor getting rusty
She found thoughts she never had
Her young ones were just as bad
She winced her weapon

Hole in her heart, feel like a lady
Fingers apart, cold, rugged and waiting
I can't believe it, Jim, how did you know where to find me?
I kept the feelings in and really thought it had cost me
Drops in her goggles aren't of love
Something's really wrong and it feels awful
Even though her body's back to normal
She once was a villain and it's hiding in her soul

I don't want to know what she did
She is not who I am
At least that's what I thought
Now I'm second guessing
I can't put my gun down
My suit's getting heavy
Something wants to be released

Something dark inside me
Dark familiarity
Something dark inside me
Dark familiarity
Something dark inside me
Dark familiarity
Something dark inside me
Dark familiarity

She opened her eyes and watched the ruins
And thought of her life and love to lose
She shook out her lenses, they'd want her back soon
The moments alone becoming scarce and few
Sure she could fight, but she's getting visions
Deeds that were unspeakable and personally did
She couldn't pose a threat to the ghost like this
He rescued her once, now it's her turn to save him

Yeah, I remember if I'll bleed and shout out my calls
The air was so dusty
Her armor getting rusty
She found thoughts she never had
Her young ones were just as bad
She winced her weapon

I don't want to know what she did
She is not who I am
At least that's what I thought
Now I'm second guessing
I can't put my gun down
My suit's getting heavy
Something wants to be released
Something dark inside me
Dark familiarity


(A second chance) or (I'II save you, Jim) not sure

Drops in her goggles aren't of love
Something's really wrong and it feels awful
My body's back to normal"

"Shazam found this song only by the ""EEEEEE"". It was like a half a second. Damn I'm impressed"
Perfect song ❤️🔥
Just watched a video about women ghosting, and then this comes up
I wish I could love the song again but unfortunate I listen to it too much in the past. Kinda annoys  me now.
"This song is 7 years old and imagine scrolling through the comments and see my comment in 2020
~2019"
"Nevermore ""shadow fiend"""
This is one of the few songs I listened to in middle school six or seven years ago which I still love. Well done Maduk and Veela
7, almost 8 years...time flies
This song takes me into some holy realm. It feels so relaxing 😊
After 7 years this song is still lit🔥🔥🔥
this is just like the song you hear at the club at night that absolutely mesmerizes you but you never get to know the name of the song. absolutely stunning.
I thought acid flashbacks were a myth, until i came by this song that I listened to on my first trip, always gives me the flashbacks, very pleasant ones, this song is pure, orgasmic bliss in it's essence. Love it.
I  played mc with this song in kohi :'(
Что, я, тут один из рашки?
Good memories with this beautiful song!<3 still listening
nearly 8 years - time has gone fast

Most overrated dnb tune of all time

Too bad Veels voice isnt like this

Starcraft <3
"2012. Back when everyone was young and carefree. Most of would stay in doors, interact with family and watch shows together. Others would play with their friends online( maybe some Minecraft or steam. And a small few would be outside, laying down on the grass and stare up into the evening blue sky or at the beautiful sunset that turns the sky into different colors wondering if this reality, this moment, would remain a beautiful, timeless, dream. I feel like this whenever I listen to this song. It gives off a special uplifting nostalgia💜

Anyone else feel like this or is it just me?"
anyone 2019 here?
This music on ecstasy is ecstasy
That's aliens music
ukraine?
Ruined at 1:05 imo
don't really know why i want to listen this song again, I know it like 7 years ago
7 years ?
I was so happy that i found this song again after not hearing it for years!!!! Such a good vibe off this song !how the hell did i forget about liquicity
Name a better song than this

Some kids from this new generation will not find about this hidden treasure.
I remember listening to this back then playing Minecraft as a 12 yo and just hangin with friends. Now today I do really miss these times as a young boy

_Drum & Bass haters are a thing, _*_unfortunately..._*
nice video to this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iYzuc_gM9U
YODÃO HIIIIIIIIII
Are the lyrics a reference to something? For some reason, they make me think of Alita Battle Angel...
This is so cringe, it sounds emo and Anime y'all are gonna hate me for this but I hate Anime and personally I hate this song but there is no reason to hate on me, everyone can have their own opinion -.-
Fuck man, I haven't heard this for years, I recognised the name and boom, flood of nostalgia, art is the best Homo Sapien invention, it's one of the only ones that doesn't kill us!

Thanks osu
Strongly dislike the Starcraft 2 story because it's so cringy, so I'm unfortunately having problems liking this song. The Kerrigan love-branch never made sense when you look at it from a Starcraft 1-perspective.
2019 anyone?

Lovely!!!!

Its May 2019 ❤

This song was my introduction to this genre of music. Back when I still did parkour. Great memories. ❤

laura brehm vibes úwù
beautiful in words, the rhythm is a great song.
I heard this song the first time about 4/5 years ago. It was on a TV show about videos picked from youtube. It was in a parkour video and was perfect for that images. Not enough fast tu use Soundhound but fortunately I catched the replay and Soundhound found it. I fell in love with this voice. Veela forever.
Bring me back to the parkour and freerunning era.....
God damn I miss this song so much
The VIP is better, but what a great song.

Mundial rusia 2018
2018
My favourite genre
racoon city
Liquicity Etonia was epic
i know this song has something to do with starcraft based off the comments, but i cant help but think of haise sasaki from tokyo ghoul with a lot of these lyrics. anyone know what i mean?
As always Veela vocals being over complicated and ruining the flow of the melody by just taking it over
still gettin goosebumps everytime I listen
Damn 6 years ago
Fun fact this song was made for Sara Kerrygan from SC2, dont believe me? Look for the cinematic called the betrayal and this song will make a lot of more sense

BEST PARKOUR SONG EVER!!!!!!
Great song very catchy.
Can some one recommend other songs with similar tunes?
To be honest, I don't like first part odnthe song, but from 00:40 till end... I will repeat this part for atleast 2 weeks 24/7
This trac i am lisn from 12 years now i am 20
Dam that moment gave me chills
Where All Da Circle?
"Doesnt matter how many times i listen to this.

This song always brings me back to my deepest memories, the memories i cherish the most, the ones i keep to my heart.

Its so weird listening to this song, because i can remember things i wouldnt normally remember without this song.

Its so weird."
Where can I get this picture without liquicity symbol?
"Maybe this song doesn't give enough ""StarCraft feeling"", but interpreting Kerrigan's story in this way is soooooooooo coooooooool!"
This fits the novel (Shatter me) so well!! ♥
"It doesnt what time it is, how old i am or what im doing.

When this song comes on, all the memories from a certain time of my life comes spreading through. Happiness, problems, sadness but most importantly: Happy moments when i was the most happy man of my life. But those times doesnt last forever.

I sure miss the times of my life where there wasnt a care in the world, but this song brings me back to those sweet mememories. I get some tears while i write this, but its worth it, because those memories.. I still remember them.

No matter how though life is, theres no reason to give up, atleast not yet, quite far from it.

Cool song when i was 16-17 old, this came out.. It really gave me hope when there was difficult times.

Thanks for creating this song."
The motherfuckin BEST PARKOUR SONG !!!!! FUUUUCK !!! I LOVE THAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Funny thing is when this song came out I added it to fav playlist, but Veela featured on so much better tracks (for me) that time I always was not sure if keep it or delete this one from favs. Today I check most popular liquicity clips and here it is top beating netsky!! Wow.
Is there a karaoke version of this?
I feel something dark in me, she says. I say, look behind you.
the ecos in the song are just...
sexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Holy fuck I remember when this came out.... so long ago
Who still is listening in 2k17 ? :D
Veela has a very sweet voice <3 and the music is also amazing

Crazy been listening to this song since it came out ,But had no clue it was from the game Starcraft...And my children's father is named Jim..our relationship  reminds me of the game,lol

"""I cant put my condom"" 1:17"
It's been 5 years already and I'm still in love with this song!
Oops just got an Eargasim
so I was listening to bloodlip and towards the end of the track I wanted to listen to this and completely forgot it was the same artist. guess I like the music they make.
Okay so I am 99% sure about this, but just so that I don't run into any complications later, can I use this song for one of my monetized videos by attributing her in description? Like Creative Commons. (Which I was expecting to be mentioned in the description).
memories :C
This is Kerrigan. We've neutralized the Protoss but there is a wave of Zerg advancing on this position. We need immediate evac...
God this is over 5 years old now?, geez. Time passes fast :/

Almost 5 years old, but hasn't aged a day!
So fun to pen tap too.
Can somebody tell me what this song is all about? Seems to me like there is a background story i dont know about
I used to love this song when it came out, but I became sick of it because I listened to it too much. I even deleted it off my phone. Recently, after 4 years of not listening to this, I scroll through YT and come across this video. I got all nostalgic and a wave of memories of me watching the night sky and listening to this track came to mind. I really love it now.
The old CoD days... I will never forget them ❤️
this is honestly the best song ive ever heard in my entire life
me too im freerunnung

""Yeah, I remember it all 
Leave and shut out my calls,"" 
The air was so dusty 
Her armour getting rusty 
She found thoughts she'd never had 
Her young ones were just as bad 
She winced at her weapon 
And hold it to

Hole in her heart, feel like a lady 
Fingers apart, cold, rugged and waiting 
""I can't believe it, Jim, how did you know where to find me? 
I kept the feelings in and really thought it had cost me.."" 
Drops in her goggles aren't of love 
Something's really wrong and it feels awful 
And even though her body's back to normal 
She once was a villain and it's hiding in her soul

""I don't want to know what 
She did, she is not who I am 
At least that's what I thought

Now I'm second guessing 
I can't put my gun down 
My suit's getting heavy 
Something wants to be released 
Something dark inside me 
Dark familiarity""

She open her eyes and watched the ruins 
And thought of her life and her love to lose 
She shook out her lenses, they'd want her back soon 
The moments alone becoming scarce and few 
Sure, she could fight, but she's getting visions 
Deeds that were unspeakable and personally did 
She couldn't pose a threat to the Ghost like this 
He rescued her once now it's her turn to save him


""Yeah, I remember it all 
Leave and shut out my calls,"" 
The air was so dusty 
Her armour getting rusty 
She found thoughts she'd never had 
Her young ones were just as bad 
She winced at her weapon 


""I don't want to know what 
She did, she is not who I am 
At least that's what I thought

Now I'm second guessing 
I can't put my gun down 
My suit's getting heavy 
Something wants to be released 
Something dark inside me 
Dark familiarity"""
Tracks like this one made me grow to love electronical music. And still, absolutely breathtaking~

"LOOKING FOR AMBROSE
I was writing with you on omegle in September 2013. You have probably 
forgotten me, but our convo on there has really followed me. Your name 
is Ambrose, and you live in Belgium, near Bruges. You showed me liquid 
drums 'n' bass and this was one of the songs you linked me to. If you see 
this, could you please reply to this, because I'd really want to know 
how your life is going now. Thanks..."

Hayalet Suikastçı

Hey komutanım, beni dinlermisiniz?

Sadece bir dakika için, gizliliğe ihtiyacım var.

Kulaklıklığını kapadı ve boynunu gerdiriyor

Kayalardan aşağı in kafasını güvende tutabilmek için.

Yeah, Hepsini hatırladım

Çık ve aramalarımı kapat,

Hava çok tozlu,

Zırhım paslanıyor

O hiç yaşamadığı düşüncelerini buldu

Onun gençliği kadar kötüydüler

Silahından irkildi

ve ona tutundu

Kalbindeki boşlukta, bir leydi gibi hissediyor

Parmakları ayrı, soğuk, sağlam ve bekliyor

""Buna inanamıyorum, Jim, Beni nerede bulacağını nasıl bildin?

Ben hissettiklerimi içimde tuttum ve gerçekten düşünmüştüm bunun bana mal olabileceğini..""

Gözlüğünden düşen damlalar aşk değil

Birşeyler gerçekten yanlış ve bu korkunç hissettiriyor

Ve hatta onun bedeninin normale dönüceğini bile düşünemedim

O birkeresinde bir haindi ve bunu kendi ruhundan saklıyor

Bilmek istemiyorum

Onun ne yaptığını, o benim olduğum kişi değil

En azından bu benim düşündüğümdü

Silahımı indiremem

Kıyafetlerim ağırlaşıyor

Birşey anlaşılmış olmak istiyor

Benim içimde olan karanlık birşey

Karanlık samimiyeti

O gözlerini açtı ve kalanları izledi

ve hayatını ve aşkını kaybettiğini düşündü

Lenslerini dışarıya salladı, yakında lensleri onu geri isterler

Anlar yanlız geliyor sınırlı ve az

Tabi, o savaşırdı, ama o gözlemliyor

Cesaretli hareketleri anlatılcak gibi değildi ve şahsen yaptım

O hayalet için bunun gibi bir tehdit olamazdı

Erkek onu bir kere kurtardı, şimdi sıra onda erkeği kurtarmak için"
